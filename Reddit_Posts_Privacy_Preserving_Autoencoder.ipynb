I mentioned this in the post as I wanted to make it clear that my friend wouldn\\u2019t be able to eat anything that touched the grill, even vegetables. It\\u2019s very strict for her due to her religion, unlike someone who is vegetarian for non-religious reasons who, for example, may be fine with eating vegetables off the same grill.\\n\\n2) You guys are right that she could have come and ate some sides. But to be honest, it\\u2019s so awkward to have one person sitting at the table, not eating, looking around at all the food. This is even more awkward at KBBQ where everyone is sharing food. And this place is more up-scale, not like a buffet-style place where they have fried chicken and other dishes too. Trust me when I say I looked at the menu lol. And my friend told me that she would have felt awkward there (after we patched things up).\\n\\n3) I can\\u2019t believe I have to say this again, but no, I\\u2019m not racist because I took her out to eat Indian food. We both like Indian food, I wasn\\u2019t \\u201cstereotyping\\u201d her.\\n\\n4) My friend only made the comment to change restaurants because she was mad.

This post concerns my oldest cousin (37M). We\\u2019ll call him Greg.\\n\\nSince they\\u2019re family and it was a very chill, spontaneous visit, and since I prioritize comfort over anything else when I know it wouldn\\u2019t be inappropriate to do so, I wore a sweatshirt and some plaid pajama pants, thinking no one would care.\\n\\nFor the most part I was right, and I even got a compliment on my pj pants from my aunt who loves pajamas and comfortable clothes as much as I do. But when Greg sat down next to me on the couch, he started telling me I shouldn\\u2019t be wearing things like that outside my house.\\n\\nHe first told me I\\u2019ll \\u201cnever get a boyfriend\\u201d if I leave the house in pajama pants. I told him I\\u2019m not trying to get a boyfriend. He asked me where exactly I wear them out, and I said around family, to friends\\u2019 places, on quick trips to convenience stores, and sometimes to morning classes (as do half of my classmates). It also took every ounce of mental fortitude not to tell him I\\u2019m really not looking for potential boyfriends at family get-togethers. He said \\u201cI\\u2019m just trying to help you. Guys will never be interested in you if you dress like that.\\u201d I told him if a guy doesn\\u2019t want me because I enjoy wearing pajama pants out sometimes then obviously I\\u2019m not interested in him either.\\n\\nHe wasn\\u2019t letting up and I was getting pissed so I essentially just told him I\\u2019m going to wear what I want and there\\u2019s not a damn thing he can do about it and left the conversation. That side of the family can be old-fashioned sometimes but this was honestly unexpected. Like why do you, a 37-year-old man, feel you must take it upon yourself to ensure the 20-year-old female cousin you see a few times a year at most looks appetizing to the male population?\\n\\nPerhaps he\\u2019d at least have some semblance of a point if I wore pajamas everywhere, including places where it would be bad to do so, but like I said, I don\\u2019t. I can safely say I\\u2019ve never worn pajamas to a job interview, family celebration, etc. But even then it\\u2019s still only about my having to be appealing to hypothetical men for him, so no, he wouldn\\u2019t have a point.\\n\\nI ignored him for the rest of the day and didn\\u2019t utter any form of goodbye when it was time to leave. I guess he complained to his mom (my aunt) about my \\u201cmassive overreaction\\u201d to his \\u201cadvice\\u201d and would like an apology since he was \\u201cjust looking out for me.\\u201d My aunt texted all this to my dad, who agrees with me but thinks I should just apologize to smooth things over. I don\\u2019t want to do that. Even if it makes things tense with that whole house, since Greg still lives with my aunt and uncle, I don\\u2019t feel I should apologize when I was the one subjected to harassment regarding my clothing choices. Besides, it\\u2019s not like Greg is some grand authority on the subject. Aside from my aunt and grandmother, he\\u2019s never felt the touch of a woman in his life.\\n\\nSo AITA for not letting this go?\\n\\nEdit: Two things.\\n\\n1. I think my dad would\\u2019ve reacted differently if my dying grandmother weren\\u2019t living with Greg because my aunt is her end-of-life caretaker. As in that house is his only access to his mother. I agree\\u2014I do wish he reacted differently, but I\\u2019m willing to cut him some slack this time. I\\u2019m going to explain the situation to him again, and I think he\\u2019ll understand this is maybe serious enough to not back down.\\n\\n2. I really, really didn\\u2019t want to share this, but I also live with severe chronic pain on a daily basis and thus seek maximum comfort whenever possible, including in my clothing choices. So the people commenting everyone sucks here can fuck right off.\\n\\n3. I have seen a few comments accusing me of rejecting requested judgment, especially regarding edit #2, so allow me to clarify: I asked whether I was an AH for refusing to apologize, not whether I was an AH for wearing pajamas out. I believe I made it quite clear that I\\u2019m comfortable with my clothing choices. That is not where I requested judgment. See title.\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nThank you (mostly) all for your wonderful, hilarious comments\\u2014I\\u2019ve done my best to keep up since I posted this and you guys have been making me laugh all day :) I will not be apologizing to Greg and instead will speak with my parents and aunt first so that they understand what he did was gross and wrong on too many levels to just gloss over it all. But I will make sure I do it in a way such that my dad can still visit his sick mom at their house without any awkwardness or problems. Thank you all for your advice :)\\n\\nAnd also thank you to everyone who ignored the question and just shat on me for my pajamas\\u2014in real life, I\\u2019m quite a non-confrontational person.

Because I live in a small town, most of the time it was the same delivery guy (we'll call him Ronald, mid 40'sM) bringing my food. And to begin with, it was fine. I'd smile, say hello, thankyou, take my food and all's good.\\n\\nIn october I got covid. Wasn't too bad, but my voice was destroyed from coughing and in the weeks after I sounded pretty wretched. I guess something about me being sick made Ronald decide I wasn't okay in general, because he got a lot more chatty after that. Always asking how I was and telling me he cared about me. It was awkward but I figured he was just being nice.\\n\\nAnyway, mid november, he showed up at my door at almost 3am. I'm a night owl so I was still up, and there he was. Visibly drunk, kinda swaying in place, going on about how he'd been walking home and saw my lights on as he passed and decided to stop and chat. Now, I am a very anxious, non-confrontational person by nature. With a strange man at my door, the last thing I wanted to do was antagonize, so I just smiled, nodded along with what he was saying and tried to get him to leave. He asked to come inside and I did shut that down quick, but otherwise I don't think I was very firm in asserting boundaries. He left after a few minutes, didn't get angry or scary or anything, just left me pretty shook up.\\n\\nI stopped ordering from that restaurant and didn't see him again until two months later when he appeared again around 2am. This time I was in bed reading and didn't engage. I could hear him calling out, asking if I was awake and if I was okay, then he left, muttering something to himself.It's been four months since then, and I'd let myself believe that it was all fine and he'd decided to stop bothering me.\\n\\nYeah, right. Tonight at 11:30pm I heard noises outside. Ronald is back, slamming the doorbell, calling out to me. I spoke to him through the door, told him that it wasn't okay to keep showing up and that if it happened again I'd call the police. He just kept repeating that 'It was fine,' and left.\\n\\nNow, a few hours later I'm still sitting up wondering if I should do something this time. I'm not worried about him in the sense that I feel I'm in any danger. He's never actually *done* anything. But it makes me anxious wondering if he's going to show up again, and so incredibly angry that he has the audacity to think this kind of behaviour is okay.\\n\\nI don't want to make things hard for him and potentially cost him his job if I report him to his workplace, and until tonight I wasn't super clear in telling him to leave me alone. But I feel like I shouldn't have to explain that knocking on a woman's door late at night when she's not expecting you is a bad thing, and after three times, I can't just ignore this anymore.\\n\\nSo, wibta if I reported him?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"selftext_anon\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1278,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yesterday, my family and I  went to visit my aunt and uncle and some cousins at the former\\u2019s house. This post concerns my oldest cousin . We\\u2019ll call him Greg.\\n\\nSince they\\u2019re family and it was a very chill, spontaneous visit, and since I prioritize comfort over anything else when I know it wouldn\\u2019t be inappropriate to do so, I wore a sweatshirt and some plaid pajama pants, thinking no one would care.\\n\\nFor the most part I was right, and I even got a compliment on my pj pants from my aunt who loves pajamas and comfortable clothes as much as I do. But when Greg sat down next to me on the couch, he started telling me I shouldn\\u2019t be wearing things like that outside my house.\\n\\nHe first told me I\\u2019ll \\u201cnever get a boyfriend\\u201d if I leave the house in pajama pants. I told him I\\u2019m not trying to get a boyfriend. He asked me where exactly I wear them out, and I said around family, to friends\\u2019 places, on quick trips to convenience stores, and sometimes to morning classes . It also took every ounce of mental fortitude not to tell him I\\u2019m really not looking for potential boyfriends at family get-togethers. He said \\u201cI\\u2019m just trying to help you. Guys will never be interested in you if you dress like that.\\u201d I told him if a guy doesn\\u2019t want me because I enjoy wearing pajama pants out sometimes then obviously I\\u2019m not interested in him either.\\n\\nHe wasn\\u2019t letting up and I was getting pissed so I essentially just told him I\\u2019m going to wear what I want and there\\u2019s not a damn thing he can do about it and left the conversation. That side of the family can be old-fashioned sometimes but this was honestly unexpected. Like why do you, a 37-year-old man, feel you must take it upon yourself to ensure the 20-year-old female cousin you see a few times a year at most looks appetizing to the male population?\\n\\nPerhaps he\\u2019d at least have some semblance of a point if I wore pajamas everywhere, including places where it would be bad to do so, but like I said, I don\\u2019t. I can safely say I\\u2019ve never worn pajamas to a job interview, family celebration, etc. But even then it\\u2019s still only about my having to be appealing to hypothetical men for him, so no, he wouldn\\u2019t have a point.\\n\\nI ignored him for the rest of the day and didn\\u2019t utter any form of goodbye when it was time to leave. I guess he complained to his mom  about my \\u201cmassive overreaction\\u201d to his \\u201cadvice\\u201d and would like an apology since he was \\u201cjust looking out for me.\\u201d My aunt texted all this to my dad, who agrees with me but thinks I should just apologize to smooth things over. I don\\u2019t want to do that. Even if it makes things tense with that whole house, since Greg still lives with my aunt and uncle, I don\\u2019t feel I should apologize when I was the one subjected to harassment regarding my clothing choices.

I told him I\\u2019m not trying to get a boyfriend. He asked me where exactly I wear them out, and I said around family, to friends\\u2019 places, on quick trips to convenience stores, and sometimes to morning classes (as do half of my classmates). It also took every ounce of mental fortitude not to tell him I\\u2019m really not looking for potential boyfriends at family get-togethers. He said \\u201cI\\u2019m just trying to help you. Guys will never be interested in you if you dress like that.\\u201d I told him if a guy doesn\\u2019t want me because I enjoy wearing pajama pants out sometimes then obviously I\\u2019m not interested in him either.\\n\\nHe wasn\\u2019t letting up and I was getting pissed so I essentially just told him I\\u2019m going to wear what I want and there\\u2019s not a damn thing he can do about it and left the conversation. That side of the family can be old-fashioned sometimes but this was honestly unexpected. Like why do you, a 37-year-old man, feel you must take it upon yourself to ensure the 20-year-old female cousin you see a few times a year at most looks appetizing to the male population?\\n\\nPerhaps he\\u2019d at least have some semblance of a point if I wore pajamas everywhere, including places where it would be bad to do so, but like I said, I don\\u2019t. I can safely say I\\u2019ve never worn pajamas to a job interview, family celebration, etc. But even then it\\u2019s still only about my having to be appealing to hypothetical men for him, so no, he wouldn\\u2019t have a point.\\n\\nI ignored him for the rest of the day and didn\\u2019t utter any form of goodbye when it was time to leave. I guess he complained to his mom (my aunt) about my \\u201cmassive overreaction\\u201d to his \\u201cadvice\\u201d and would like an apology since he was \\u201cjust looking out for me.\\u201d My aunt texted all this to my dad, who agrees with me but thinks I should just apologize to smooth things over. I don\\u2019t want to do that. Even if it makes things tense with that whole house, since Greg still lives with my aunt and uncle, I don\\u2019t feel I should apologize when I was the one subjected to harassment regarding my clothing choices. Besides, it\\u2019s not like Greg is some grand authority on the subject. Aside from my aunt and grandmother, he\\u2019s never felt the touch of a woman in his life.\\n\\nSo AITA for not letting this go?\\n\\nEdit: Two things.\\n\\n1. I think my dad would\\u2019ve reacted differently if my dying grandmother weren\\u2019t living with Greg because my aunt is her end-of-life caretaker. As in that house is his only access to his mother. I agree\\u2014I do wish he reacted differently, but I\\u2019m willing to cut him some slack this time. I\\u2019m going to explain the situation to him again, and I think he\\u2019ll understand this is maybe serious enough to not back down.\\n\\n2. I really, really didn\\u2019t want to share this, but I also live with severe chronic pain on a daily basis and thus seek maximum comfort whenever possible, including in my clothing choices. So the people commenting everyone sucks here can fuck right off.\\n\\n3. I have seen a few comments accusing me of rejecting requested judgment, especially regarding edit #2, so allow me to clarify: I asked whether I was an AH for refusing to apologize, not whether I was an AH for wearing pajamas out. I believe I made it quite clear that I\\u2019m comfortable with my clothing choices. That is not where I requested judgment. See title.\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nThank you (mostly) all for your wonderful, hilarious comments\\u2014I\\u2019ve done my best to keep up since I posted this and you guys have been making me laugh all day :) I will not be apologizing to Greg and instead will speak with my parents and aunt first so that they understand what he did was gross and wrong on too many levels to just gloss over it all.

We\\u2019ll call him Greg.\\n\\nSince they\\u2019re family and it was a very chill, spontaneous visit, and since I prioritize comfort over anything else when I know it wouldn\\u2019t be inappropriate to do so, I wore a sweatshirt and some plaid pajama pants, thinking no one would care.\\n\\nFor the most part I was right, and I even got a compliment on my pj pants from my aunt who loves pajamas and comfortable clothes as much as I do. But when Greg sat down next to me on the couch, he started telling me I shouldn\\u2019t be wearing things like that outside my house.\\n\\nHe first told me I\\u2019ll \\u201cnever get a boyfriend\\u201d if I leave the house in pajama pants. I told him I\\u2019m not trying to get a boyfriend. He asked me where exactly I wear them out, and I said around family, to friends\\u2019 places, on quick trips to convenience stores, and sometimes to morning classes (as do half of my classmates). It also took every ounce of mental fortitude not to tell him I\\u2019m really not looking for potential boyfriends at family get-togethers. He said \\u201cI\\u2019m just trying to help you. Guys will never be interested in you if you dress like that.\\u201d I told him if a guy doesn\\u2019t want me because I enjoy wearing pajama pants out sometimes then obviously I\\u2019m not interested in him either.\\n\\nHe wasn\\u2019t letting up and I was getting pissed so I essentially just told him I\\u2019m going to wear what I want and there\\u2019s not a damn thing he can do about it and left the conversation. That side of the family can be old-fashioned sometimes but this was honestly unexpected. Like why do you, a 37-year-old man, feel you must take it upon yourself to ensure the 20-year-old female cousin you see a few times a year at most looks appetizing to the male population?\\n\\nPerhaps he\\u2019d at least have some semblance of a point if I wore pajamas everywhere, including places where it would be bad to do so, but like I said, I don\\u2019t. I can safely say I\\u2019ve never worn pajamas to a job interview, family celebration, etc. But even then it\\u2019s still only about my having to be appealing to hypothetical men for him, so no, he wouldn\\u2019t have a point.\\n\\nI ignored him for the rest of the day and didn\\u2019t utter any form of goodbye when it was time to leave. I guess he complained to his mom (my aunt) about my \\u201cmassive overreaction\\u201d to his \\u201cadvice\\u201d and would like an apology since he was \\u201cjust looking out for me.\\u201d My aunt texted all this to my dad, who agrees with me but thinks I should just apologize to smooth things over. I don\\u2019t want to do that. Even if it makes things tense with that whole house, since Greg still lives with my aunt and uncle, I don\\u2019t feel I should apologize when I was the one subjected to harassment regarding my clothing choices. Besides, it\\u2019s not like Greg is some grand authority on the subject. Aside from my aunt and grandmother, he\\u2019s never felt the touch of a woman in his life.\\n\\nSo AITA for not letting this go?\\n\\nEdit: Two things.\\n\\n1. I think my dad would\\u2019ve reacted differently if my dying grandmother weren\\u2019t living with Greg because my aunt is her end-of-life caretaker. As in that house is his only access to his mother. I agree\\u2014I do wish he reacted differently, but I\\u2019m willing to cut him some slack this time. I\\u2019m going to explain the situation to him again, and I think he\\u2019ll understand this is maybe serious enough to not back down.\\n\\n2. I really, really didn\\u2019t want to share this, but I also live with severe chronic pain on a daily basis and thus seek maximum comfort whenever possible, including in my clothing choices. So the people commenting everyone sucks here can fuck right off.\\n\\n3. I have seen a few comments accusing me of rejecting requested judgment, especially regarding edit #2, so allow me to clarify: I asked whether I was an AH for refusing to apologize, not whether I was an AH for wearing pajamas out. I believe I made it quite clear that I\\u2019m comfortable with my clothing choices. That is not where I requested judgment. See title.\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nThank you (mostly) all for your wonderful, hilarious comments\\u2014I\\u2019ve done my best to keep up since I posted this and you guys have been making me laugh all day :) I will not be apologizing to Greg and instead will speak with my parents and aunt first so that they understand what he did was gross and wrong on too many levels to just gloss over it all. But I will make sure I do it in a way such that my dad can still visit his sick mom at their house without any awkwardness or problems. Thank you all for your advice :)\\n\\nAnd also thank you to everyone who ignored the question and just shat on me for my pajamas\\u2014in real life, I\\u2019m quite a non-confrontational person. I suppose it\\u2019s more accurate to say that I don\\u2019t shy away from it when I feel it\\u2019s necessary, but I definitely avoid engaging if possible. That is to say, I\\u2019ve never so vigorously stood up for myself as I have on this post, and it was your comments that gave me that opportunity for growth. Not sarcasm\\u2014I do appreciate it. I\\u2019m going to apply these skills I didn\\u2019t know I had when I next speak with Greg. Some advice: I challenge each and every one of you to dare to think beyond arbitrary social rules created by random bipedal mammals whose existence will inevitably vanish at the death of the sun.

Because I live in a small town, most of the time it was the same delivery guy (we'll call him Ronald, mid 40'sM) bringing my food. And to begin with, it was fine. I'd smile, say hello, thankyou, take my food and all's good.\\n\\nIn october I got covid. Wasn't too bad, but my voice was destroyed from coughing and in the weeks after I sounded pretty wretched. I guess something about me being sick made Ronald decide I wasn't okay in general, because he got a lot more chatty after that. Always asking how I was and telling me he cared about me. It was awkward but I figured he was just being nice.\\n\\nAnyway, mid november, he showed up at my door at almost 3am. I'm a night owl so I was still up, and there he was. Visibly drunk, kinda swaying in place, going on about how he'd been walking home and saw my lights on as he passed and decided to stop and chat. Now, I am a very anxious, non-confrontational person by nature. With a strange man at my door, the last thing I wanted to do was antagonize, so I just smiled, nodded along with what he was saying and tried to get him to leave. He asked to come inside and I did shut that down quick, but otherwise I don't think I was very firm in asserting boundaries. He left after a few minutes, didn't get angry or scary or anything, just left me pretty shook up.\\n\\nI stopped ordering from that restaurant and didn't see him again until two months later when he appeared again around 2am. This time I was in bed reading and didn't engage. I could hear him calling out, asking if I was awake and if I was okay, then he left, muttering something to himself.It's been four months since then, and I'd let myself believe that it was all fine and he'd decided to stop bothering me.\\n\\nYeah, right. Tonight at 11:30pm I heard noises outside. Ronald is back, slamming the doorbell, calling out to me. I spoke to him through the door, told him that it wasn't okay to keep showing up and that if it happened again I'd call the police. He just kept repeating that 'It was fine,' and left.\\n\\nNow, a few hours later I'm still sitting up wondering if I should do something this time. I'm not worried about him in the sense that I feel I'm in any danger. He's never actually *done* anything. But it makes me anxious wondering if he's going to show up again, and so incredibly angry that he has the audacity to think this kind of behaviour is okay.\\n\\nI don't want to make things hard for him and potentially cost him his job if I report him to his workplace, and until tonight I wasn't super clear in telling him to leave me alone.

This post concerns my oldest cousin (37M). We\\u2019ll call him Greg.\\n\\nSince they\\u2019re family and it was a very chill, spontaneous visit, and since I prioritize comfort over anything else when I know it wouldn\\u2019t be inappropriate to do so, I wore a sweatshirt and some plaid pajama pants, thinking no one would care.\\n\\nFor the most part I was right, and I even got a compliment on my pj pants from my aunt who loves pajamas and comfortable clothes as much as I do. But when Greg sat down next to me on the couch, he started telling me I shouldn\\u2019t be wearing things like that outside my house.\\n\\nHe first told me I\\u2019ll \\u201cnever get a boyfriend\\u201d if I leave the house in pajama pants. I told him I\\u2019m not trying to get a boyfriend. He asked me where exactly I wear them out, and I said around family, to friends\\u2019 places, on quick trips to convenience stores, and sometimes to morning classes (as do half of my classmates). It also took every ounce of mental fortitude not to tell him I\\u2019m really not looking for potential boyfriends at family get-togethers. He said \\u201cI\\u2019m just trying to help you. Guys will never be interested in you if you dress like that.\\u201d I told him if a guy doesn\\u2019t want me because I enjoy wearing pajama pants out sometimes then obviously I\\u2019m not interested in him either.\\n\\nHe wasn\\u2019t letting up and I was getting pissed so I essentially just told him I\\u2019m going to wear what I want and there\\u2019s not a damn thing he can do about it and left the conversation. That side of the family can be old-fashioned sometimes but this was honestly unexpected. Like why do you, a 37-year-old man, feel you must take it upon yourself to ensure the 20-year-old female cousin you see a few times a year at most looks appetizing to the male population?\\n\\nPerhaps he\\u2019d at least have some semblance of a point if I wore pajamas everywhere, including places where it would be bad to do so, but like I said, I don\\u2019t. I can safely say I\\u2019ve never worn pajamas to a job interview, family celebration, etc. But even then it\\u2019s still only about my having to be appealing to hypothetical men for him, so no, he wouldn\\u2019t have a point.\\n\\nI ignored him for the rest of the day and didn\\u2019t utter any form of goodbye when it was time to leave. I guess he complained to his mom (my aunt) about my \\u201cmassive overreaction\\u201d to his \\u201cadvice\\u201d and would like an apology since he was \\u201cjust looking out for me.\\u201d My aunt texted all this to my dad, who agrees with me but thinks I should just apologize to smooth things over. I don\\u2019t want to do that. Even if it makes things tense with that whole house, since Greg still lives with my aunt and uncle, I don\\u2019t feel I should apologize when I was the one subjected to harassment regarding my clothing choices. Besides, it\\u2019s not like Greg is some grand authority on the subject.

I\\u2019m going to explain the situation to him again, and I think he\\u2019ll understand this is maybe serious enough to not back down.\\n\\n2. I really, really didn\\u2019t want to share this, but I also live with severe chronic pain on a daily basis and thus seek maximum comfort whenever possible, including in my clothing choices. So the people commenting everyone sucks here can fuck right off.\\n\\n3. I have seen a few comments accusing me of rejecting requested judgment, especially regarding edit #2, so allow me to clarify: I asked whether I was an AH for refusing to apologize, not whether I was an AH for wearing pajamas out.

Not USA.\\n\\nI (24M) am still living with my parents until my house is ready, but I don't live for free.\\n\\nMy brother (36M) lived with his wife and when she got pregnant, he had to work overseas for an indefinite period of time and talking to my parents, they decided that my SIL would stay with us so she wouldn't be alone during the pregnancy and labor. No parents alive from her side. I don't have a close relationship with my SIL.\\n\\nLast Thursday, my parents were out of town to run some errands and I was at my job which is 10 minutes from home. My SIL without a car.\\n\\nThings about my work: I am lawyer; some months of the year, I have a jury as the main lawyer; There is no prohibition on the use of cell phones, but I can't use them all the time ; , in cases, as the main lawyer in the case, there is no chance of me leaving in the middle. This happened last thursday.\\n\\nMy SIL called my phone so I hung up the call and she sent me several messages that demand that I'm going home as she was in labor and needed someone to take her.\\n\\nI said I was working and couldn't leave for the next hour, but that she could call an Uber or ask a friend for help because I can't at the moment.\\n\\nShe seemed irritated and replied: \\\"Your nephew will be born, your work can wait  to help more family\\\"\\n\\nMe \\\"I'm sorry, but I'm busy and I can't\\\"\\n\\nHer: \\\"Don't you think your nephew isn't more important than this?\\\"\\n\\nMe, without patience and needing to focus: \\\"Not right now, ask someone else for help.\\\"\\n\\nI turned off the phone and in fact, it took a whole day.\\n\\nMy nephew is healthy, my SIL got a ride with a friend of hers who lives \\\"close\\\" (15 minutes) to home.\\n\\nI am being criticized by my parents and brother for refusing to help her and choosing my service and even though I say it was unfortunate, because it was just the only day in 3 months that I couldn't help that she went into labor , it didn't do any good because they are saying that I showed my true colors and that it was clear that my work comes first.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAITA?\",\n          \"Around the end of last year one of the local fast food places started doing deliveries and I (38F), took advantage of the convenience. Because I live in a small town, most of the time it was the same delivery guy (we'll call him Ronald, mid 40'sM) bringing my food. And to begin with, it was fine. I'd smile, say hello, thankyou, take my food and all's good.\\n\\nIn october I got covid. Wasn't too bad, but my voice was destroyed from coughing and in the weeks after I sounded pretty wretched. I guess something about me being sick made Ronald decide I wasn't okay in general, because he got a lot more chatty after that. Always asking how I was and telling me he cared about me. It was awkward but I figured he was just being nice.\\n\\nAnyway, mid november, he showed up at my door at almost 3am. I'm a night owl so I was still up, and there he was. Visibly drunk, kinda swaying in place, going on about how he'd been walking home and saw my lights on as he passed and decided to stop and chat. Now, I am a very anxious, non-confrontational person by nature. With a strange man at my door, the last thing I wanted to do was antagonize, so I just smiled, nodded along with what he was saying and tried to get him to leave. He asked to come inside and I did shut that down quick, but otherwise I don't think I was very firm in asserting boundaries. He left after a few minutes, didn't get angry or scary or anything, just left me pretty shook up.\\n\\nI stopped ordering from that restaurant and didn't see him again until two months later when he appeared again around 2am. This time I was in bed reading and didn't engage. I could hear him calling out, asking if I was awake and if I was okay, then he left, muttering something to himself.It's been four months since then, and I'd let myself believe that it was all fine and he'd decided to stop bothering me.\\n\\nYeah, right. Tonight at 11:30pm I heard noises outside. Ronald is back, slamming the doorbell, calling out to me. I spoke to him through the door, told him that it wasn't okay to keep showing up and that if it happened again I'd call the police. He just kept repeating that 'It was fine,' and left.\\n\\nNow, a few hours later I'm still sitting up wondering if I should do something this time. I'm not worried about him in the sense that I feel I'm in any danger. He's never actually *done* anything. But it makes me anxious wondering if he's going to show up again, and so incredibly angry that he has the audacity to think this kind of behaviour is okay.\\n\\nI don't want to make things hard for him and potentially cost him his job if I report him to his workplace, and until tonight I wasn't super clear in telling him to leave me alone. But I feel like I shouldn't have to explain that knocking on a woman's door late at night when she's not expecting you is a bad thing, and after three times, I can't just ignore this anymore.\\n\\nSo, wibta if I reported him?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"selftext_anon\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1278,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yesterday, my family and I  went to visit my aunt and uncle and some cousins at the former\\u2019s house.

My SIL without a car.\\n\\nThings about my work: I am lawyer; some months of the year, I have a jury as the main lawyer; There is no prohibition on the use of cell phones, but I can't use them all the time ; , in cases, as the main lawyer in the case, there is no chance of me leaving in the middle. This happened last thursday.\\n\\nMy SIL called my phone so I hung up the call and she sent me several messages that demand that I'm going home as she was in labor and needed someone to take her.\\n\\nI said I was working and couldn't leave for the next hour, but that she could call an Uber or ask a friend for help because I can't at the moment.\\n\\nShe seemed irritated and replied: \\\"Your nephew will be born, your work can wait  to help more family\\\"\\n\\nMe \\\"I'm sorry, but I'm busy and I can't\\\"\\n\\nHer: \\\"Don't you think your nephew isn't more important than this?\\\"\\n\\nMe, without patience and needing to focus: \\\"Not right now, ask someone else for help.\\\"\\n\\nI turned off the phone and in fact, it took a whole day.\\n\\nMy nephew is healthy, my SIL got a ride with a friend of hers who lives \\\"close\\\"  to home.\\n\\nI am being criticized by my parents and brother for refusing to help her and choosing my service and even though I say it was unfortunate, because it was just the only day in 3 months that I couldn't help that she went into labor , it didn't do any good because they are saying that I showed my true colors and that it was clear that my work comes first.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAITA?\",\n          \"Around the end of last year one of the local fast food places started doing deliveries and I , took advantage of the convenience. Because I live in a small town, most of the time it was the same delivery guy  bringing my food. And to begin with, it was fine. I'd smile, say hello, thankyou, take my food and all's good.\\n\\nIn october I got covid. Wasn't too bad, but my voice was destroyed from coughing and in the weeks after I sounded pretty wretched. I guess something about me being sick made Ronald decide I wasn't okay in general, because he got a lot more chatty after that. Always asking how I was and telling me he cared about me. It was awkward but I figured he was just being nice.\\n\\nAnyway, mid november, he showed up at my door at almost 3am. I'm a night owl so I was still up, and there he was. Visibly drunk, kinda swaying in place, going on about how he'd been walking home and saw my lights on as he passed and decided to stop and chat. Now, I am a very anxious, non-confrontational person by nature. With a strange man at my door, the last thing I wanted to do was antagonize, so I just smiled, nodded along with what he was saying and tried to get him to leave. He asked to come inside and I did shut that down quick, but otherwise I don't think I was very firm in asserting boundaries. He left after a few minutes, didn't get angry or scary or anything, just left me pretty shook up.\\n\\nI stopped ordering from that restaurant and didn't see him again until two months later when he appeared again around 2am. This time I was in bed reading and didn't engage. I could hear him calling out, asking if I was awake and if I was okay, then he left, muttering something to himself.It's been four months since then, and I'd let myself believe that it was all fine and he'd decided to stop bothering me.\\n\\nYeah, right. Tonight at 11:30pm I heard noises outside. Ronald is back, slamming the doorbell, calling out to me. I spoke to him through the door, told him that it wasn't okay to keep showing up and that if it happened again I'd call the police. He just kept repeating that 'It was fine,' and left.\\n\\nNow, a few hours later I'm still sitting up wondering if I should do something this time. I'm not worried about him in the sense that I feel I'm in any danger. He's never actually *done* anything. But it makes me anxious wondering if he's going to show up again, and so incredibly angry that he has the audacity to think this kind of behaviour is okay.\\n\\nI don't want to make things hard for him and potentially cost him his job if I report him to his workplace, and until tonight I wasn't super clear in telling him to leave me alone. But I feel like I shouldn't have to explain that knocking on a woman's door late at night when she's not expecting you is a bad thing, and after three times, I can't just ignore this anymore.\\n\\nSo, wibta if I reported him?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sex\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

This post concerns my oldest cousin (37M). We\\u2019ll call him Greg.\\n\\nSince they\\u2019re family and it was a very chill, spontaneous visit, and since I prioritize comfort over anything else when I know it wouldn\\u2019t be inappropriate to do so, I wore a sweatshirt and some plaid pajama pants, thinking no one would care.\\n\\nFor the most part I was right, and I even got a compliment on my pj pants from my aunt who loves pajamas and comfortable clothes as much as I do. But when Greg sat down next to me on the couch, he started telling me I shouldn\\u2019t be wearing things like that outside my house.\\n\\nHe first told me I\\u2019ll \\u201cnever get a boyfriend\\u201d if I leave the house in pajama pants. I told him I\\u2019m not trying to get a boyfriend. He asked me where exactly I wear them out, and I said around family, to friends\\u2019 places, on quick trips to convenience stores, and sometimes to morning classes (as do half of my classmates). It also took every ounce of mental fortitude not to tell him I\\u2019m really not looking for potential boyfriends at family get-togethers. He said \\u201cI\\u2019m just trying to help you. Guys will never be interested in you if you dress like that.\\u201d I told him if a guy doesn\\u2019t want me because I enjoy wearing pajama pants out sometimes then obviously I\\u2019m not interested in him either.\\n\\nHe wasn\\u2019t letting up and I was getting pissed so I essentially just told him I\\u2019m going to wear what I want and there\\u2019s not a damn thing he can do about it and left the conversation. That side of the family can be old-fashioned sometimes but this was honestly unexpected. Like why do you, a 37-year-old man, feel you must take it upon yourself to ensure the 20-year-old female cousin you see a few times a year at most looks appetizing to the male population?\\n\\nPerhaps he\\u2019d at least have some semblance of a point if I wore pajamas everywhere, including places where it would be bad to do so, but like I said, I don\\u2019t. I can safely say I\\u2019ve never worn pajamas to a job interview, family celebration, etc. But even then it\\u2019s still only about my having to be appealing to hypothetical men for him, so no, he wouldn\\u2019t have a point.\\n\\nI ignored him for the rest of the day and didn\\u2019t utter any form of goodbye when it was time to leave. I guess he complained to his mom (my aunt) about my \\u201cmassive overreaction\\u201d to his \\u201cadvice\\u201d and would like an apology since he was \\u201cjust looking out for me.\\u201d My aunt texted all this to my dad, who agrees with me but thinks I should just apologize to smooth things over. I don\\u2019t want to do that. Even if it makes things tense with that whole house, since Greg still lives with my aunt and uncle, I don\\u2019t feel I should apologize when I was the one subjected to harassment regarding my clothing choices. Besides, it\\u2019s not like Greg is some grand authority on the subject. Aside from my aunt and grandmother, he\\u2019s never felt the touch of a woman in his life.\\n\\nSo AITA for not letting this go?\\n\\nEdit: Two things.\\n\\n1. I think my dad would\\u2019ve reacted differently if my dying grandmother weren\\u2019t living with Greg because my aunt is her end-of-life caretaker. As in that house is his only access to his mother. I agree\\u2014I do wish he reacted differently, but I\\u2019m willing to cut him some slack this time. I\\u2019m going to explain the situation to him again, and I think he\\u2019ll understand this is maybe serious enough to not back down.\\n\\n2. I really, really didn\\u2019t want to share this, but I also live with severe chronic pain on a daily basis and thus seek maximum comfort whenever possible, including in my clothing choices. So the people commenting everyone sucks here can fuck right off.\\n\\n3. I have seen a few comments accusing me of rejecting requested judgment, especially regarding edit #2, so allow me to clarify: I asked whether I was an AH for refusing to apologize, not whether I was an AH for wearing pajamas out. I believe I made it quite clear that I\\u2019m comfortable with my clothing choices. That is not where I requested judgment. See title.\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nThank you (mostly) all for your wonderful, hilarious comments\\u2014I\\u2019ve done my best to keep up since I posted this and you guys have been making me laugh all day :) I will not be apologizing to Greg and instead will speak with my parents and aunt first so that they understand what he did was gross and wrong on too many levels to just gloss over it all. But I will make sure I do it in a way such that my dad can still visit his sick mom at their house without any awkwardness or problems. Thank you all for your advice :)\\n\\nAnd also thank you to everyone who ignored the question and just shat on me for my pajamas\\u2014in real life, I\\u2019m quite a non-confrontational person. I suppose it\\u2019s more accurate to say that I don\\u2019t shy away from it when I feel it\\u2019s necessary, but I definitely avoid engaging if possible. That is to say, I\\u2019ve never so vigorously stood up for myself as I have on this post, and it was your comments that gave me that opportunity for growth. Not sarcasm\\u2014I do appreciate it. I\\u2019m going to apply these skills I didn\\u2019t know I had when I next speak with Greg. Some advice: I challenge each and every one of you to dare to think beyond arbitrary social rules created by random bipedal mammals whose existence will inevitably vanish at the death of the sun.
